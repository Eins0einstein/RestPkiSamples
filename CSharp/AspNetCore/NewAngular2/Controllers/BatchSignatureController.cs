				they are actually changes done to the document prior to signing, not binded to any signature. Therefore, any number
				of marks can be added, for instance one per page, whereas there can only be one visual representation per signature.
				However, since the marks are in reality changes to the PDF, they can only be added to documents which have no previous
				signatures, otherwise such signatures would be made invalid by the changes to the document (see property
				PadesSignatureStarter.BypassMarksIfSigned). This problem does not occurr with signature visual representations.

				We have encapsulated this code in a method to include several possibilities depending on the argument passed.
				Experiment changing the argument to see different examples of PDF marks (valid values are 1-3). Once you decide which 
                is best for your case, you can place the code directly here.
